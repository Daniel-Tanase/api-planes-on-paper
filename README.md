# api-planes-on-paper - REST API in Spring Boot and Java

- API Planes on paper is a software intermediary that allows the multiplayer mobile game application and the server to talk and interact with each other via HTTP requests.

- When you use the multiplayer game application on your mobile phone, the app connects to the internet and sends data to a server. The server then retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions, and sends it back to your phone. The mobile application then interprets that data and presents you with the information you wanted in a readable way.

- This API also provides a layer of security, the client's phone's data is never fully exposed to the server, and likewise, the server is never fully exposed to the client's phones. Instead, each communicates with small packets of data, sharing only that which is necessary.
